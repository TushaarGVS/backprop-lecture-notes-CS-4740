\section{Summary}
\label{sec:5}

We have developed an understanding of how neural nets use gradients to optimize a given objective function, and the ways of efficiently computing those gradients. In the following lectures, we will see how backpropagation by repeated chain rule application poses serious problems in training recurrent nets.
